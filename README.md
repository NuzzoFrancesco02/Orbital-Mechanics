# Orbital Mechanics

This repository contains exercises and simulations related to the Orbital Mechanics course, part of the Master's program in Space Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. It focuses on practical exercises and simulations concerning orbital mechanics and space systems.

## Contents

- **Labs/**: This folder contains various exercises and scripts related to the Orbital Mechanics course. The content is organized into specific topics:
  - **Coordinate Systems**: Exercises on different orbital coordinate systems.
  - **Keplerian Elements**: Scripts to calculate and visualize orbital parameters.
  - **Orbital Transfers**: Methods for calculating interplanetary transfers, including Lambert's problem.
  - **Elliptic and Hyperbolic Orbits**: Analysis and simulations of different orbital types.
  
Each lab is designed to help understand and apply fundamental concepts in orbital mechanics.

## Requirements

- **MATLAB**: Required to run `.m` scripts.
- **Simulink**: Required for opening `.slx` files.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NuzzoFrancesco02/Orbital-Mechanics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
